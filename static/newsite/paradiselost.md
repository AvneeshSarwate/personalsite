As part of my work with [Grind Arts Company](http://www.grindarts.com/), I have been involved in the development of an immersive experience based on the story of Paradise Lost, and much of my work has involved creating real-time graphics that complement the motions of dancers.

In the spring of 2018 we put on a small scale production as part of the [LPAC Rough Draft Festival](http://www.lpac.nyc/rough-draft-2018). Though official recordings of the performance have not been released yet, below are some recordings from the development workshop, as well as live examples (in browser, desktop only) of some of the interactive graphics used. 

Workshop footage:
- [ChromaKeying](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVjCoopAx3q/): a texture-on-texture effect that was applied to dancers during the piece.
- [Self-Layering](https://www.instagram.com/p/BggvgPLjZc9): a self-layering effect using chromakeying and wave-displacement of the original image
- [Pixelation](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bghe61Hhz4q): an experiment with applying pixelation and noise to colors on a dark background. 
- [Promo Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adZlVNJmr44) a promo reel made from the workshop that highlighted some of the types of effects (chromakeying, video-delay, kaleidescoping) that were used with the dancers. 

Live Examples (Desktop Chrome only):
- [Example 1](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?ae_peanutButter6) - pixelation, mirroring, color-warping, and distorted motion-trails
- [Example 2](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?ae_peanutButter0) - live example of the self-layering effect described above
- [Example 3](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?hexLumaDiffBlock) - hexagonal pixelation and noise applied to the moving parts of the camera image
- [Example 4](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?ae_peanutButter7) - color-based texture remapping onto the camera feed
