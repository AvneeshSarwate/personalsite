<b>Interactive Visuals (under development)</b>
===============
<div>[Back to main page](http://www.avneeshsarwate.com#)</div>

I like to play with [shaders](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/)<sup>1</sup>. 
<span class="marginnote">
<sup>1</sup> Works on both desktop (mic/camera input) and mobile (touch input). Both versions are built using a fork of Shawn Lawson's framework [The Force](https://github.com/avneeshsarwate/The_Force/tree/master). Some other shader experiments are on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/avneeshsarwate/).

Especially interactive shaders (hit Ctrl+V to show sliders, Ctrl+Shift to show code)
- [Dancer-morph](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?yoyovideotest9) 
- [Camera-morph](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?snoiseCamWarp_slider)
- [Shape-morph](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?lightLine_slider)

I'm also into [p5](https://p5js.org/), and like making interaactive things like [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/p5Experiments/?optical), [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/p5Experiments/?bodygrav), and [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/p5Experiments/?hulldraw).

More recently I've experimenting with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to dig deeper into GPU power in 2D and 3D sketches like [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/three-sketches/sketches/yegor_painting/?id=1), [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/three-sketches/sketches/yegor_painting/?id=2), [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/three-sketches/sketches/yegor_painting/?id=3), and [this](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/three-sketches/sketches/yegor_painting/?id=7)

I like to do interactive/VJ style visuals with touchscreens and MIDI controllers, like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVnhsVkHLzc/), [this](https://youtu.be/mZgzgJ57O3E?t=40m32s), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZgzgJ57O3E&feature=youtu.be&t=49m31s), and [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0jvuotvyzucf0x/2018-03-27%2013.52.52.mov?dl=0).

Some of my interactive visuals work was used in [Paradise Lost](/paradiselost#), and in some of my [audiovisual compositions](/audiovisualperformance).

My research interests have recently grown to include music-responsive graphics and "visual instruments," so this page will be growing in the near future.
