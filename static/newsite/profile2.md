===============

I'm a software engineer, musician, interface designer, and [visual artist](/art#) and am particularly interested in audiovisual live performance and improvisation. I like to thinking of programming systems/lanugages from an interface-design perspective, especially as they apply to art making, and have recently started exploring the affordances of [coding agents for creative work](https://github.com/avneeshSarwate/codex). I am based in NYC.

You can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/avneeshsarwate/), [GitHub](https://github.com/AvneeshSarwate), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avneesh-sarwate-16172662), and [GMail](mailto:avneeshsarwate@gmail.com). 

## **Recent short talks** (2025)
The best way to get a sense of what I'm currently interested and how I got there is via these two talks (~7 minutes each).
 - [New Inc Demo Day talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/SERpjuB9hBM?si=Xe7n3UT0Ax21BlT_&t=15458) - which covers my creative history and current project on audiovisual composition.
 - [South Park Commons demo](https://youtu.be/XPd1fQA0PjU) - which discusses how I think about building software tools for art, and covers my history of work from a more interface design oriented perspective.

## **Quick Intro** (older stuff, 2017-2021)
In particular, I'm interested in [audiovisual live performance](/audiovisualperformance#)  and have a background in designing [interfaces for musical performance](/electronicimprovisation#) (for which I have some [publications](/publications#)). I'm also interested in [interactive graphics](/interactivevisuals#) more generally. 

I am also a member of [Grind Arts Company](http://www.grindarts.com/) and an alumnus of the [Princeton Laptop Orchestra](http://plork.princeton.edu/index.php).

<!-- And to round out this intro, my [resume](/static/papers/Sarwate_Resume.pdf). -->

## **Longer stuff** (relatively newer stuff, 2021-2025)
Below are some longer documents that give more context on my creative and technical motivations.

In 2021 I gave an artist talk at Stanford's [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) about my approach to audiovisual live performance, as well as reviewing some past work. The slides and speaker notes of the ~45 minute talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D7NDcneOhzQLNmKaKb-PcEIQdSOv9JuZU8DrUk4IPuY/edit?usp=sharing) (with demos, both video and in-browser, linked in the slides). The talk is still a good representation of some of questions I am interested in exploring, though the particulars of the tooling I use is out of date. 

I am currently working on building Typescript libraries for building interactive audiovisual art in the browser [(code)](https://github.com/AvneeshSarwate/browser_drawn_projections). This is a collaboration with [Sumanth Srinivasan](https://www.acrosspolyethylene.com). Our recent grant application describes the motivations and goals for this project [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SzhiWNNl4-cxMOKpqOuUeGhP_3eecu0_Rg3aw3Hg2Kg/edit?usp=sharing).
