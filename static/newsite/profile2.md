===============

I'm a software engineer and musician working with computer music and [interactive art](/art#), based in NYC. In particular, I'm interested in [audiovisual live performance](/audiovisualperformance#)  and have a background in designing [interfaces for musical performance](/electronicimprovisation#) (for which I have some [publications](/publications#)). I'm also interested in [interactive graphics](/interactivevisuals#) more generally.

I am also a member of [Grind Arts Company](http://www.grindarts.com/) and an alumnus of the [Princeton Laptop Orchestra](http://plork.princeton.edu/index.php).

And to round out this intro, my [resume](/static/papers/Sarwate_Resume.pdf).

P.S. - I recently gave an artist talk at Stanford's [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) that summarizes much of my current focus, as well as reviewing some past work. The slides and speaker notes of the ~45 minute talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D7NDcneOhzQLNmKaKb-PcEIQdSOv9JuZU8DrUk4IPuY/edit?usp=sharing) (with demos, both video and in-browser, linked in the slides).
