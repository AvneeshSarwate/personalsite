## **Quick Intro** (older links)

I'm a software engineer and musician working with computer music and [interactive art](/art#), based in NYC. In particular, I'm interested in [audiovisual live performance](/audiovisualperformance#)  and have a background in designing [interfaces for musical performance](/electronicimprovisation#) (for which I have some [publications](/publications#)). I'm also interested in [interactive graphics](/interactivevisuals#) more generally.

I am also a member of [Grind Arts Company](http://www.grindarts.com/) and an alumnus of the [Princeton Laptop Orchestra](http://plork.princeton.edu/index.php).

And to round out this intro, my [resume](/static/papers/Sarwate_Resume.pdf).

## **Longer stuff** (newer links)
Below are some longer documents that give more context on my creative and technical motivations.

In 2021 I gave an artist talk at Stanford's [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) about my approach to audiovisual live performance, as well as reviewing some past work. The slides and speaker notes of the ~45 minute talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D7NDcneOhzQLNmKaKb-PcEIQdSOv9JuZU8DrUk4IPuY/edit?usp=sharing) (with demos, both video and in-browser, linked in the slides). The talk is still a good representation of some of questions I am interested in exploring, though the particulars of the tooling I use is out of date. 

I am currently working on building Typescript libraries for building interactive audiovisual art in the browser [(project page)](https://avneeshsarwate-webart.netlify.app/). This is a collaboration with [Sumanth Srinivasan](https://www.acrosspolyethylene.com) and a part of our project as Year 11 cohort members at [New Inc.](https://www.newmuseum.org/new-inc/)
