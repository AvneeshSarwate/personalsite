## <a id="interfaces"></a><b>Composing <=> Improvising</b>
- "Composing" - detail oriented, fine grained
- "Improvising"  - off the cuff, maybe "realtime"
    - REACTIVE (to your own output, or others)
- "Liveness" is critical for "performing"

## <a id="interfaces"></a><b>Liveness with Graphics Programming</b>
- Liveness levels with computers [ex](http://localhost:6310/?miniexample)
    - executable        -   reload program
    - edit triggered    -   livecoding
    - stream driven     -   mapped sliders
    - [from this paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/855f/bc05b565e544d93c924871c86dd0047d946e.pdf)
- Speed vs Complexity tradeoff
    - things that change most often are made most "live"

## <a id="interfaces"></a><b>Why I like Liveness</b>
- Creative flow, happy accidents
- Jamming with OTHER PEOPLE
- Liveness => making "instruments"
    - why not send people instruments? [like this one](https://avneeshsarwate.github.io/The_Force/?lightLine_slider)

## <a id="interfaces"></a><b>Questions for You</b>
- Does liveness make sense for your medium and practice
- What kind of live workflows could you envision or want in an ideal world?
- What kind of "configurable/remixable" objects would you want to send collaborators?
- I want to know!
